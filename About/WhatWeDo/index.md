FIRST is a multi-national, non-profit organization that works *F*or *I*nspiration and *R*ecognition of *S*cience and *T*echnology. It aspires to transform our culture making science, math, engineering, and technology as cool as sports for kids.

One of the events FIRST hosts is the FRC, or FIRST Robotics Competition. FRC is an international competition spanning a period of roughly 4 months, from January to April. Every year when the competition begins, an FRC team receives a Kit of Parts and a challenge.

Once we receive our parts and our challenge, we have 6 weeks to build a robot that fulfils the challenge. The challenge is set up like a game; there is a simple objective with lots of strategy to think about and multiple ways to tackle the problem. It roughly models an actual engineering development cycle, but in 6 weeks instead of 18 months. 
    
Once we've dissected the rules for the challenge, we must build the robot from the Kit of Parts and up to $4000 of other parts. The students get to design the robot, program the robot, and build the robot from raw aluminium, wires, and grease. Of course, we're not thrown into a room with no clue on how to accomplish all this. We have *mentors* who work in robotics or engineering fields who volunteer their time and talents to guide each team.
    
FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology. Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, we are challenged to raise funds, design a team "brand," and hone teamwork skills so we can complete our robot. In addition, we will also have to give community presentations, participate in business planning and preform community outreach in order to get both new members and more money to purchase resources for their robot. 

The biggest things we learn are teamwork and gracious professionalism, a strong contrast from the rough treatment of most other high school sports. As members of an FRC team we have a chance to develop big dreams for our future and your world, and the experience to accomplish it.
