			<p>FIRST is a multi-national, non-profit organization that works
				For Inspiration and Recognition of Science and Technology.
				It aspires to transform our culture making science, math,
				engineering, and technology as cool as sports for kids.</p>
			<p>One of the events FIRST puts on to achieve it's goal is the FRC, or FIRST Robotics Competition.
				The FIRST Robotics Competition is an international competition spanning a period of roughly 4 months,
				from January to April. Every year when the competition begins, an FRC team receives a Kit of Parts
				and a challenge.</p>
			<p>Once we receive our parts and our challenge, we have 6 weeks to build a robot that fulfils the challenge.
				The challenge is set up like a game; there is a simple objective with lots of strategy to think about
				and multiple ways to tackle the problem. Essentially the idea is that it roughly models an actual
				engineering development cycle, but in 6 weeks instead of 18 months. Once we've dissected the rules
				for the challenge, we must build the robot from the Kit of Parts and whatever metal or wood we can
				get our hands on. The students get to design the robot, program the robot, and even build the robot
				from aluminium, motors and grease. Of course, we're not thrown into a room with no clue on how to
				accomplish all this. We have professionals who work in robotics or engineering fields who
				volunteer their time and talents to guide each team.</p>
			<p>FRC combines the excitement of sport with the rigors of science and technology.
				Under strict rules, limited resources, and time limits, we are challenged to raise funds,
				design a team "brand," and hone teamwork skills so we can complete our robot.
				In addition, we will also have to give community presentations, participate in business
				planning and preform community outreach in order to get both new members and more money
				to purchase resources for their robot. The biggest things we learn are teamwork and
				gracious professionalism, a strong contrast from the rough treatment of most other high
				school sports. We are your future workforce. As members of an FRC team we have a chance to
				develop big dreams for our future and your world.</p>
