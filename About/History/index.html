			<h2>2014</h2>
				<p>Before 2014 our school was a sad, robotics-less void. Thankfully, with the help of Justin and Curtis Campbell, former students of another high school that competed in FRC, and also of Donald Heeke, local science teacher, the team was founded. After being announced, the signup sheet quickly filled. In no time at all the designated robotics room was filled with people that, to say the least, had no idea what precisely they were getting themselves into. The most anybody knew was that this involved robotics in some description, and more likely that not that meant playing with motorized LEGO. Everyone quickly learned that could not be farther than the truth. We studied the competition of the previous year and learned generally what was up, but everybody still barely knew what was to come.</p>
				
				<p>Quickly came Kickoff Day that January. We all drove ourselves to one of the local high schools to see the Kickoff. There we learned the goal of that year's game, which was more or less taking gigantic exercise balls and chuck them into holes in the wall. Seemed easy enough. What made this hard, though, was the fact that build season conveniently happened to coincide with the Great Snowpocolapse of 2014. This meant that getting to the school was nigh-on impossible, considering our rural-y backwoods location. Combined with our collective lack of FRC experience, it was a miracle the robot got done.</p>
				
				<p>After that 6 weeks, we finally ended up with a robot that worked decently well. We weren't totally blind when it came to competitions, as we attended the one in Kettering just to see what it would be like. However, we'd never actually been in a competition. Turns out being in a crowd is a lot more exciting when you have a personal attachment to the game. We easily got into the spirit of the crowd (Cotton-Eye Joe still haunts my deepest nightmares) and we ended up doing pretty alright for a first-year team with almost no experience.</p>
				
			<h2>2015</h2>
				<p>For the next year, we looked at what we did less than well the previous year, a lot of which was simply lackluster communication and rapidly changing build dates. We got a mailing list set up and made our dates consistent, and that seemed to fix a lot.</p>

				<p>Having some experience this time, we took the challenge (stacking storage totes up to 6 high and putting trash containers on top), and produced a robot that definitely worked but admittedly wasn't great. It had a good concept, having a little loading chute built in, but it couldn't do containers. Our assumption was that we would make a bunch of tote stacks and a bot on our team dedicated to stacking containers on stacks would do that. As it turned out, nobody ever made that mystical container bot, as they all made their own stacks and but the container on top of that.</p>
				
				<p>So, with our 6 hours of time we had to alter our robot between competitions, we quickly added a pneumatics-based mechanism that took care of containers. It worked well. Stupidly well. We got high scores pretty much every time. It went from stupidly well to ungodly well once the Drive team found a hackish method for placing the cylindrical containers on the flat side by releasing it early.</p>
				
				<p>With that, along with various other very helpful things like a stronger team identity, a really neat pit layout, more emphasis on team scouting, <!--And by that I mean I hacked together an SQL query during a competition despite barely knowing SQL. I'm still proud of that. It had no right to work at all. But, of course, I have to thank the folks who made the scouting sheet more sane. Undeniably helpful for both me and the human reviewers aka the entire team. Okay, comment over. --Aaron Hancock --> better organized code, better organized wiring, and a robot design that was just useful to have around, we made it for the first time ever to the Worlds Championships in St. Louis, MO. Here's to hoping we can do just as great in 2016!
