			<h2>2015 - Stackie Chan</h2>
				<!--TODO: Add gallery, write blurb. -->
				<p>He got us to Worlds in 2015.</p>
			
			<h2>2014 - Bruce Lee</h2>
				<!--TODO: Add gallery. -->
				<p>For our first robot, Bruce Lee has done well. He got us pretty far for our little experience as a team. He might have lost twice as many matches as he won, and he might not have been the most reliable robot on the planet, but that's not the important part. He got us excited for robotics and STEM. As a testbed on wheels and a learning experience, Bruce Lee has gone above and beyond the call of duty. Building him back in 2014 was an insane feat of fun. Students that never even touched a powertool in their lives were cutting aluminium bars in half. People learned team organization and working in a group much better than any silly history class assignment could ever hope to.</p>
				
				<p>Bruce Lee is still teaching even today. He's been gutted and rebuilt, had several attachments added on, had several parts taken off... He's been worked on by many people for many purposes. He was a t-shirt and candy cannon during a parade. He was an interactive demo for our team. He's a testbed for experimental code. Bruce Lee is the robot that just keeps on giving.</p>
