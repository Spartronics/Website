			<h2>2015 World Championships</h2>
				<ul>
				<li>15th place in Archimedes Division</li>
				
				<li>Average Qualification Score: 125.40 </li>
				<li>Average Play-Off Score: 145.00 </li>
				<li>Got up to quarterfinals</li>
				</ul>
				
			<p>World Championships were an interesting experience. It was an experience that started at 3AM
				in our high school's parking lot. The "core team" was supposed to drive from Michigan to St.
				Louis in time to get the pits set up that day, and 3AM was the latest time that allowed that
				without staying in a hotel. So we spent a good 6 hours or so half-asleep, cooped up in
				trucks or compact cars or whatever was capable of driving the distance.</p>
			<p>The drive was mostly uneventful. The guy I was riding with fell asleep watching Battleship
				on his laptop. I just groggily stared out the window, watching the scenery slowly change from
				hilly farmland to really hilly grassland, watching as the colors changed from the dark blue of
				the night to the piercing oranges and yellows of the morning.</p>
			<p>Around 4 or 5 we stopped at some corner gas station somewhere in northern Illinois (or maybe
				Indiana or Ohio. Somewhere around there.) We all lined up for the single bathroom. Some of
				us grabbed some breakfast from the McDonalds next door. By the time the sun rose we continued on.</p>
			<p>After more pretty scenery/sleep, depending on who you asked, we stopped at a Denny's well within
				Illinois and had a proper breakfast that comprised of a lot more than a single sad attempt at a
				hash brown. It was a well-deserved meal for the madness that was to come.</p>
			<p>Eventually we got to the Atrium, a hotel in the sketchy suburbs of St. Louis that was to
				be our home for the next few days. (The car I was in took a tour of downtown first
				due to the GPS not quite knowing where the address was. As it turns out every big-box store
				was within driving distance of our hotel. We used a grand total of 0 of them.)
				The Atrium was formerly a Holiday Inn, but for whatever reason they lost the license.</p>
			<p>I'm sure back when it was made in the 70's or whenever it was a nice, upscale place.
				Now it was more like "upscale on a budget", if that makes any sense. The rooms were a
				big vertical stack, 4 stories high. If you were lucky (or unlucky, depending on who
				you asked) your room faced the interior plaza. The plaza, scanning from the front entrance
				to the back, comprised of some chairs, a depressed area with more chairs, a TV, and a
				ping-pong table outside, and past that a weirdly shaped pool. On the side opposite the
				rooms were a restaurant and a ballroom. I never went to either of them, but they looked
				decent enough. The Atrium felt like a weird, dysfunctional little community. Friendly,
				but you have no idea how they've survived this long.</p>
			<p>We pretty much swung by our room, dropped off our bags, and scooted off to St. Louis.
				The drive across the Mississippi was filled with anticipation. And then we very quickly
				got ourselves lost right smack-dab in the heart of St. Louis. You see, the GPS we were
				using is not very good in cities. So instead of having us just take the exit straight
				to the dome, it took us on a tour across half the city just so we could go down a block
				and go all the way back. It was, however, a rather nice tour. St. Louis is not really
				one of those tours I'd want to live in, but you do have to admit the sights of urban
				decay and obsolete machinery mixed with the revitalizing community of St. Louis was
				really fascinating. What was even more fascinating was some random radio event that
				was going on, calling out the young, hip folks of St. Louis. It's strange to consider
				that such a different place has such familiar aspects.</p>
			<p>Scenery descriptions aside, we quickly found ourselves outside the Edward Jones Dome.
				To say it was decorated for the event is an understatement. If you could see the stadium,
				you knew there was a robotics competition going on that day. We thankfully found a concrete
				parking garage very close by, so we went in, got up to the 3rd floor or so. We would have
				just walked out of the wonderful mess of stone, but there was a crowd in front of the
				entrance. A huge crowd, at that. Going down would have done absolutely nothing for us,
				so we just stayed near the car and watched the giant pool of people slowly but surely
				drain into the building through the 3 open entrances. Once it was pretty much clear we
				headed down the dusty, dimly lit stairs and headed into the dome.</p>
			<p>Now, this wasn't just a "walk in and sit down" sort of affair. We had to get name badges,
				I guess due to the sheer amount of people in the building. And, of course, we had to compete
				in line with the people pool from earlier.</p>

				</ul>
				<p>A large part of our vastly improved performance compared
					to the last event at Waterford was a major re-engineering
					of the robot, and specifically how it dealt with containers.</p>
				<p>We ditched the "Narwhal" used in the Waterford competition,
					which was a giant metal pole with a hook. It was supposed to
					hook into the hole in the container and pick it up. In practice
					this almost never worked properly, and when it did it was too
					slow and unstable to be useful.</p>
				<p>In the 6 hours provided to work on the robot between competitions,
					we cut off the Narwhal and placed on a pneumatic-based can grabber
					that quickly and elegantly grabbed onto the can and raised it above
					the stack, so it could be placed on.</p>
				<p>The idea with this was that a stack would be made up to the height
					of the container, and then the arms would let go of the container
					and you'd have a stack with a container on top.</p>
				<p>However, during a practice run, the drivers let go of the arms early.
					Instead of the can just falling down, bouncing off the totes and onto
					the floor, it <em>held onto the arm and swung itself vertically.</em>
					This meant the container would automatically place itself on the stack
					right-side up, adding extra stability compared to laying on its side.</p>
				<p>This accidental revelation probably single-handedly took us from stumbling
					around in the quarterfinals of a district event to stumbling around
					in the quarterfinals of the Archimedes Division in St. Louis.
					(That's not to discredit the drive team for realizing the potential in
					this, the build team for building the arms in the first place, or
					the business team for raising the money to get us to St. Louis.)</p>
					
				<p>We'd like to imagine the Team Spirit Award was a result of our crowd
					going nuts due to actually winning a decent amount of matches, but
					it was a touch more than that. Even though we had mostly the same
					routine as the last competition, we really resonated the crowd.</p>
				<p>For example, on more than one occasion the MC decided to wear our
					mohawk while he was announcing the teams in our match. What probably
					really did it, though, was the playoff alliance.</p>
				<p>We were with The Blue Devils (4130) and the Electropanthers (4815).
					They were both the best teams we could had picked. An interesting thing
					that all 3 teams just coincidentally happened to have in common was
					that we all had accessories: us having the light-up mohawks, the Blue
					Devils having their light-up blue devil horns, and the Electropanthers
					having 3D-printed orange dogtags.</p>
				<p>Someone down in one of the drive teams had the brilliant idea to have
					each drive team member wear <em>ALL</em> of the accessories. That meant
					everyone in the drive team was sporting a mohawk, devil horns and a dogtag.
					It was a beautiful moment of cooperation you couldn't reproduce if you tried.</p>
					
				<p>The Industrial Safety Award is a lot more boring a story. It was mostly due to the
					fact we had a nice, compact pit, with shelves and tables arranged in a U with the
					people and the robot in the middle. We also left every fire extinguisher, MSDS,
					hospital address and first aid kit we had within plain sight. Obviously I'm
					downplaying our achievements a bit (I wasn't in the pits for that often, so I
					really don't know if there was more to that), but as it turns out not having
					a cluttered mess for the sake of aesthetics really helps.</p>
					
				<p>Also as a self-horn-tooting side-note, half the reason we even got TO
					the semifinals was a much improved method of scouting for alliance
					members. The scouting system for Waterford was pretty much a disaster.</p>
				<p>It went something roughly like this: We wrote some information on some
					paper scouting sheets, we ran out of scouting sheets halfway through
					the first day, we threw them all in a bag, and about 5 minutes before
					we had to choose we retrieved the sheets from the bag, said "Yeah, that
					team looks good", and picked them for our 3rd team in the alliance.
					(Well, alright, I'm exaggerating a little bit. But that wasn't too
					far off from the truth.)</p>
				<p>Needless to say, although those teams were decent on their own, we didn't
					mesh well together <em>at all</em>. This time around, we brought a few
					more sheets and studied the results a bit more closely. What also really
					helped was that somebody on the team (*coughmecough*) <!--*coughAaronHancockcough*-->
					decided that there was no way we could possibly look over all the sheets in the
					time we had. So I took a spare team laptop (the low-end Classmate, with
					a processor roughly as powerful as a grapefruit) and quickly got a 
					rudimentary database going. I took a bunch of the scouting sheets,
					entered them into the database and somehow within a span of 2 days
					created a query that spat out a list of best potential alliances 
					despite the fact that I barely knew what I was doing.</p>
				<p>In hindsight it really should not have worked
					as well as it did (it was missing data for some of the teams, for one) 
					but it was a plausible enough list. We were supposed to cross-reference that
					list with the manual combthrough but, like I predicted, there was no time and
					so they just took the output of my list and ran with it. OK, horn-tooting time over.</p>
