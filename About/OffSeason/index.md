## Flocking
Our most successful fundraising event by far is Flocking. Flocking consists of placing 30 to 80 plastic lawn flamingos into an unsuspecting victim's yard. The flamingos are then removed one day later. While the flock is there, the flockee is given the option, for a small fee, to command the flock towards the yard of a new victim. The flock of flamingos migrates from yard to yard, commanded by each previous victim. This fundraising tactic has been extremely successful in raising funds for our team. 

## Parade
Our town often hosts parades, usually one in the summer and one in the winter. Pretty much every chance we can, we get into these parades. When we're going down the road, either driving the robot and shooting balls or launching candy through PVC pipes attached to an old robot's pnumatic system, the kids absoultely love us. And the adults, too. We're sure we're inspiring the many kids that see a *robot* drive down *their* street to think about going into a field of science.

## Zombie Run
Every year during the fall, we participate in the Horton Lake Zombie Run as a fundraising event.
It's a Halloween-themed 5K obstacle course where the runners have to go through a zombie-infested
land in search of an antidote armed with a water gun. We, naturally, are the zombies. While there
isn't much oppurtunity to push our robot (after all, we're too busy being dead), but it does get
our name out there and is an excellent team-bonding event.


## Robo-Frenzy
Robo-Frenzy was a small off-season competion at St. Clair Community College over the summer of 2015.
Us and 11 other local teams went to the event. Of those 12, we were the winners, getting first place
and a nice amount of money to fund our team for 2016. And fun, obviously. Can't foreget the fun.

## Kettering Kickoff
We participated in this September 19 of 2015. We got in 4th place, out of 42 teams.

## All Girl's Event
This was an event that took place in Bloomfield Hills [date].
The catch here is that only girls are allowed to drive the robot and be in the pits.
Thankfully, due to our efforts in increasing the number of female team-members, we had
some enthusiastic women ready to rock it. And rock it they did, as our team was an event finalist.
