Welcome to the homepage of FRC Team 5048, the Spartronics of Imlay City, MI.

FRC, the FIRST Robotics Competition, is a yearly competition with teams competing from all around the globe. FIRST, founded in 1989 by Dean Kamen and Woodie Flowers, is a non-profit organization that stands *F*or *I*nspiration and *R*ecognition of *S*cience and *T*echnology.

We don't just build robots here at Spartronics. We participate in community strengthening activities such as the Relay for Life, Imlay City Blueberry Festival and the Michigan Renaissance Festival.

The future is bright for us, as we make it our mission to Light it Up. Our goal is to spread the awareness of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and inspire students to help create the backbone for our ever-changing society.
