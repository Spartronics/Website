Welcome to the homepage of FRC Team 5048, the Spartronics of Imlay City, MI.

FRC is a yearly competition put on by FIRST, a non-profit organization founded in 1989 that stands *F*or *I*nspiration and *R*ecognition of *S*cience and *T*echnology. FRC is a worldwide competition with teams from all around the globe.

And we don't just build robots. We participate in community strengthening activities such as
the Relay for Life, Imlay City Blueberry Festival and the Michigan Renaissance Festival.

The future is bright for us, as we make it our mission to Light it Up. Our goal is to spread the awareness of STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and inspire students to help create the backbone for our ever-changing society.
